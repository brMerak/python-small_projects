Some small projects that I have done in order to learn Python

UPDATE 1 ******

1) Hangman and Oldest_Dog:
  a) Hangman - a very simple game of Hangman. With words picked at random. Will display if you have guessed the world correctly
     or if you ran out of guesses.
   
  b) Oldest_Dog - this was a challenge I've found online. The objective was to create a function that would display the oldest
     dog from a list. I have improved the challenge by allowing people to input their own dogs and displaying if one or more dogs
     are the oldest.
